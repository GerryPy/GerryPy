GerryPy is an open source project that demonstrates the effectiveness of computers in drawing United States congressional districts. In our current legal system, each state's districts are drawn by a commitee designated by the political party in power, which enables the unconstitutional practice of gerrymandering. With GerryPy, a user can click a button and generate fairly drawn districts for their state in a matter of seconds. Of course, a lot will have to change before federal laws allow for the district drawing process to become automated, but with demonstratable solutions like GerryPy available online for free, we hope to build support from the public towards implementing them in the future.
